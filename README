NAME
    DBIx::Class::Schema::Diff - Diff two schemas, regardless of version
    numbers

VERSION
    0.00

DESCRIPTION
        Is there a project which can check out two tags/commits from
        git and make a diff between the two schemas? So instead of
        having the version information in the database, I would like
        to A) make a diff between database and the current checked out
        version from the repo B) make a diff between two git-versions.

SYNOPSIS
        use DBIx::Class::Schema::Diff;

        my $diff = DBIx::Class::Schema::Diff->new(
                        from => $dsn,
                        to => 'MyApp::Schema',
                    );

        # write diff to disk
        $diff->create_ddl_dir($path);

ATTRIBUTES
  from
    Any source (module name, dbh or dsn) which has the old version of the
    schema.

  to
    Any source (module name, dbh or dsn) which has the new version of the
    schema.

METHODS
  create_ddl_dir
    Will write the diff between "from" and "to" to a selected directory -
    one file per table.
